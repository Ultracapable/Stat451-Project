# Stat451-Project

## Research Question
The primary question we aim to explore is: **What factors have a main impact on determining the admissions status of Wharton's Class of 2025 applicants?**

## Project Overview
This project will utilize synthetic data generated from the statistics of the Wharton Class of 2025. The dataset includes various features such as applicant gender, GPA, GMAT scores, work experience, and major, as well as the admission status (Admit, Waitlist, Deny). Our goal is to perform an exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships and patterns among these variables, focusing on how they correlate with admission outcomes.

## Data Sources
The primary dataset consists of the following columns:
- **application_id**: Unique identifier for each application
- **gender**: Applicant's gender (Male, Female)
- **international**: International student status (TRUE/FALSE)
- **gpa**: Grade Point Average on a 4.0 scale
- **major**: Undergraduate major (Business, STEM, Humanities)
- **race**: Racial background (White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, Other)
- **gmat**: GMAT score out of 800
- **work_exp**: Years of work experience
- **work_industry**: Previous work industry (Consulting, Finance, Technology, etc.)
- **admission**: Admission status (Admit, Waitlist, Deny)

## Analysis Goals
We will create visualizations to analyze the influence of gender, GPA, GMAT scores, work experience, and major on admission status. Our findings will provide insights into the admissions process and highlight any potential biases present in the data.

## Impact of Research Question on Admissions

Our research question has significant implications for understanding and improving the admissions process. By exploring the various factors that influence admission decisions, we aim to provide insights that can benefit both the admissions committee and prospective applicants in the following ways:

1. **Identifying Biases and Inequities**: Analyzing the relationships between demographic factors (such as gender, race, and international status) and admission outcomes can reveal potential biases in the admissions process. This understanding can help the admissions committee create more equitable practices and policies that ensure all applicants are evaluated fairly, regardless of their background.

2. **Optimizing Admissions Criteria**: By evaluating the impact of academic performance indicators like GPA and GMAT scores alongside experiential factors like work experience and industry background, the admissions committee can refine their criteria. This research can guide them in balancing quantitative and qualitative aspects of applicants, ensuring a holistic review process that aligns with Wharton's values and goals.

3. **Enhancing Applicant Guidance**: The insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for prospective applicants. Understanding which factors significantly influence admissions can help applicants tailor their applications more effectively, focusing on areas that align with the admissions committee's expectations. This guidance can empower applicants to present their strengths and experiences in a way that resonates with the selection criteria.

In summary, our research question is not just an academic inquiry; it has practical implications that can lead to a more equitable, efficient, and effective admissions process at Wharton, fostering an inclusive environment that benefits all stakeholders involved.
