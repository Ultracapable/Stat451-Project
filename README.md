# Stat451-Project

## Research Question
The primary question we aim to explore is: **What factors have a main impact on determining the admissions status of Wharton's Class of 2025 applicants?**

## Project Overview
This project will utilize synthetic data generated from the statistics of the Wharton Class of 2025. The dataset includes various features such as applicant gender, GPA, GMAT scores, work experience, and major, as well as the admission status (Admit, Waitlist, Deny). Our goal is to perform an exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships and patterns among these variables, focusing on how they correlate with admission outcomes.

## Data Sources
The primary dataset consists of the following columns:
- **application_id**: Unique identifier for each application
- **gender**: Applicant's gender (Male, Female)
- **international**: International student status (TRUE/FALSE)
- **gpa**: Grade Point Average on a 4.0 scale
- **major**: Undergraduate major (Business, STEM, Humanities)
- **race**: Racial background (White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, Other)
- **gmat**: GMAT score out of 800
- **work_exp**: Years of work experience
- **work_industry**: Previous work industry (Consulting, Finance, Technology, etc.)
- **admission**: Admission status (Admit, Waitlist, Deny)

## Analysis Goals
We will create visualizations to analyze the influence of gender, GPA, GMAT scores, work experience, and major on admission status. Our findings will provide insights into the admissions process and highlight any potential biases present in the data.
